# Rigorous Quantum Field Theory

This module contains mathematically rigorous foundations for quantum field theory,
including:

- **vNA**: Von Neumann algebras and Tomita-Takesaki modular theory
- **SPDE**: Stochastic partial differential equations and regularity structures

## Overview

The vNA module provides the operator-algebraic foundations needed for algebraic
quantum field theory (AQFT), while the SPDE module provides tools for constructive
QFT approaches using stochastic quantization.
