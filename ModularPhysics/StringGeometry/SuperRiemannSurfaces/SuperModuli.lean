# Supermoduli Space and the Donagi-Witten Theorem

This file develops the theory of supermoduli spaces - the moduli of
super Riemann surfaces - with particular focus on the Donagi-Witten
theorem on non-projectedness.

## Mathematical Background

### Super Riemann Surfaces

A super Riemann surface (SRS) is a (1|1)-dimensional complex supermanifold
with a superconformal structure: a rank (0|1) distribution D ⊂ T with [D,D] = T/D.

### The Supermoduli Space 𝔐_g

The supermoduli space 𝔐_g parametrizes super Riemann surfaces of genus g.
As a supermanifold (or superstack), it has dimension:
  dim 𝔐_g = (3g - 3 | 2g - 2)   for g ≥ 2

The even dimension 3g - 3 comes from deformations of the reduced surface.
The odd dimension 2g - 2 comes from deformations of the superconformal structure.

### The Projection Π : 𝔐_g → M_g

There is a forgetful map Π : 𝔐_g → M_g sending a SRS to its reduced surface.
The fiber over a point [Σ] ∈ M_g is the space of superconformal structures
on Σ, which is related to spin structures.

### Non-Projectedness (Donagi-Witten)

A supermanifold M is **projected** if it is isomorphic to Π(M_red, E) for
some vector bundle E → M_red, where Π(M_red, E) has structure sheaf ∧•E*.

**Donagi-Witten Theorem**: For g ≥ 5, the supermoduli space 𝔐_g is NOT projected.

This means 𝔐_g has "intrinsically supergeometric" structure that cannot be
reduced to classical geometry plus a vector bundle. This has deep implications
for superstring perturbation theory.

### The Obstruction

The obstruction to projectedness lives in H¹(M_g, Sym²(E)) where E is the
bundle of odd deformations. Donagi-Witten showed this is nonzero for g ≥ 5.

## The Supermoduli Space 𝔐_g

The supermoduli space parametrizes super Riemann surfaces.
It is a complex supermanifold (or superorbifold/superstack for small g).
-/

/-- The supermoduli space 𝔐_g of genus g super Riemann surfaces.

    This is a complex superorbifold (or superstack for g ≤ 2 due to automorphisms).
    The structure includes:
    - A body (the underlying topological space)
    - Even and odd tangent spaces at each point
    - The projection to ordinary moduli space M_g

    The dimension (3g-3 | 2g-2) is a theorem, not part of the definition.
    It must be proven using deformation theory of super Riemann surfaces.

    Note: For g ≥ 5, this space is NOT projected (Donagi-Witten theorem),
    meaning it has intrinsically supergeometric structure. -/

    At a point [Σ, D] representing a super Riemann surface, the even tangent space is:

      T^{odd}_{[Σ,D]} 𝔐_g ≅ H¹(Σ, D)
    where D is the superconformal distribution (a spin structure K^{1/2}).

/-- The odd dimension of 𝔐_g equals 2g - 2 for g ≥ 2.

    The odd tangent space at a point [Σ, D] of 𝔐_g parametrizes deformations of
    the superconformal structure D on a fixed underlying Riemann surface Σ.

    Proof outline (following Witten "Notes on Super Riemann Surfaces"):
    - The odd tangent space is H⁰(Σ, K^{3/2}) (gravitino variations)
    - By Riemann-Roch for K^{3/2} (degree = 3(g-1) = 3g - 3):
      χ(K^{3/2}) = h⁰(K^{3/2}) - h¹(K^{3/2}) = deg(K^{3/2}) - g + 1 = (3g-3) - g + 1 = 2g - 2
    - By Serre duality: h¹(K^{3/2}) = h⁰(K ⊗ K^{-3/2}) = h⁰(K^{-1/2})
    - For g ≥ 2, deg(K^{-1/2}) = -(g-1) < 0, so h⁰(K^{-1/2}) = 0
    - Therefore dim T^{odd} = h⁰(K^{3/2}) = 2g - 2

    The 2g - 2 odd moduli correspond to the gravitino zero modes on the worldsheet. -/

## Spin Structures and Odd Moduli

The odd directions in 𝔐_g are parametrized by spin structures on the
reduced surface. A super Riemann surface determines a spin structure
on its body (the square root of the canonical bundle).

    - deg(K^{3/2}) = 3(g-1) = 3g - 3
    - χ(K^{3/2}) = (3g - 3) - g + 1 = 2g - 2
    - h¹(K^{3/2}) = h⁰(K^{-1/2}) = 0 for g ≥ 2 (negative degree)

## Projected Supermanifolds

A supermanifold is projected if it has the form Π(M, E) where:
- M is an ordinary manifold
- E → M is a vector bundle
- The structure sheaf is ∧•E* (exterior algebra of dual bundle)

Projected supermanifolds are "split" - they decompose as classical
geometry plus a bundle. The key question is whether 𝔐_g is projected.

## The Projectedness Obstruction

For a supermanifold M with body M_red and odd tangent bundle E,
the obstruction to being projected lives in H¹(M_red, Sym²E).

This comes from the short exact sequence:
  0 → Sym²E → J²/J³ → E → 0
where J is the ideal of nilpotents in the structure sheaf.

exact sequence 0 → Sym²E → J²/J³ → E → 0, where E is the Hodge bundle and
J is the nilpotent ideal sheaf. -/

## The Donagi-Witten Theorem

The main theorem: for g ≥ 5, the supermoduli space 𝔐_g is NOT projected.

The proof involves:
1. Identifying the obstruction class in H¹(M_g, Sym²E)
2. Showing it's nonzero using the geometry of M_g
3. The key input is that certain Hodge bundles have nontrivial extensions

of Donagi-Witten. The proof requires detailed cohomology computations
involving the Hodge bundle on moduli space.

/-- The Hodge bundle over M_g.

    The Hodge bundle (also called the Hodge line bundle in rank 1 case) is
    the vector bundle E = π_*(ω_{𝒞/M_g}) over M_g whose fiber over [Σ]
    is H⁰(Σ, K), the space of holomorphic 1-forms on Σ.

    This is a fundamental object in the geometry of moduli space:
    - Its determinant det(E) is the Hodge line bundle λ
    - The Chern class c₁(λ) is the Hodge class
    - The Weil-Petersson metric on M_g is related to the Hodge bundle -/

/-- The rank of the Hodge bundle over M_g is g (for any g).

    Proof: By Riemann-Roch for K on a genus g surface:
    - deg(K) = 2g - 2
    - χ(K) = h⁰(K) - h¹(K) = (2g - 2) - g + 1 = g - 1
    - By Serre duality: h¹(K) = h⁰(O) = 1
    - Therefore rank(E) = h⁰(K) = g -/

## Implications for String Theory

The non-projectedness of 𝔐_g has important consequences for
superstring perturbation theory:

1. Loop amplitudes cannot be reduced to integrals over M_g plus
   a simple Gaussian integral over odd directions

2. The super-period matrix and supermoduli integration require
   intrinsically supergeometric techniques

3. Picture-changing formalism must be handled carefully

    In superstring perturbation theory, the g-loop n-point amplitude is:
      A_{g,n} = ∫_{𝔐_{g,n}} ⟨ V₁ ⋯ Vₙ ⟩
    where V_i are vertex operators and the integral is over supermoduli space.

    The integrand involves the super-period matrix and picture-changing operators.
    Non-projectedness of 𝔐_g (for g ≥ 5) means this cannot be reduced to an
    ordinary integral over M_g times a Gaussian over odd directions.

/-! The key lemma is that H¹(M_g, Sym²E) ≠ 0 for g ≥ 5.
The proof uses degeneration to the boundary of M̄_g and induction on genus.

### The Donagi-Witten Argument (Outline)

The proof that 𝔐_g is not projected for g ≥ 5 proceeds as follows:

1. **Obstruction identification**: The obstruction to projectedness lies in H¹(M_g, Sym²E)
   where E is the "odd tangent bundle" with fiber H⁰(Σ, K^{3/2}) at [Σ].

2. **Extension to compactification**: The obstruction extends to H¹(M̄_g, Sym²Ē) where
   Ē extends E to the Deligne-Mumford compactification.

3. **Boundary analysis**: Near the boundary divisor Δ_0 ⊂ M̄_g (non-separating nodes),
   the obstruction restricts non-trivially.

4. **Inductive argument**: Using the boundary restriction and factorization properties,
   the non-vanishing for g ≥ 5 follows from explicit computations at low genus.

5. **Key computation**: For g = 5, dim H¹(M_5, Sym²E) > 0 by Riemann-Roch on M̄_5.

## Cohomology Computations for Donagi-Witten

The key to proving non-projectedness is computing cohomology groups on M_g.
We outline the necessary framework.

### The Odd Tangent Bundle E

The odd tangent bundle E over M_g has fiber H⁰(Σ, K^{3/2}) at [Σ] ∈ M_g,
where K^{3/2} is the spin bundle (square root of the canonical bundle).

**Properties:**
- rank(E) = 2g - 2 (by Riemann-Roch for K^{3/2})
- c₁(E) = λ/2 where λ is the Hodge class
- E exists globally only when we choose a spin structure

### Riemann-Roch for K^{3/2}

For a spin structure on Σ (choice of L with L² = K):
- deg(L) = g - 1
- χ(L) = (g-1) - g + 1 = 0 by Riemann-Roch
- h⁰(L) - h¹(L) = 0
- By Serre duality: h¹(L) = h⁰(K ⊗ L*) = h⁰(L) (since K = L²)
- So h⁰(L) = h¹(L), and generically both equal (g-1)/2 for g odd

For the parity of h⁰(L), the Arf invariant determines whether h⁰ is even or odd.

### The Euler Characteristic χ(Sym²E)

Using GRR on M_g:
  χ(Sym²E) = ∫_{M_g} ch(Sym²E) · td(T_{M_g})

The Chern character of Sym²E:
  ch(Sym²E) = (r choose 2) + (r-1)c₁(E) + ... where r = rank(E) = 2g - 2

The Todd class of T_{M_g} involves κ classes and boundary corrections.

### Vanishing Theorems

For large degree bundles on M_g:
- H^i(M_g, V) = 0 for i > dim(M_g) = 3g - 3 (cohomological dimension)
- H²(M_g, Sym²E) = 0 for g ≥ 5 by Kodaira vanishing (after twisting)

### Boundary Restriction

For the boundary divisor Δ_0 ⊂ M̄_g (curves with one non-separating node):
- Δ_0 is birational to M_{g-1,2} (genus g-1 with 2 marked points)
- Restriction gives: H¹(M̄_g, Sym²Ē) → H¹(Δ_0, Sym²Ē|_{Δ_0})
- The inductive step uses that the restriction is non-trivial

## Implications for Superstring Theory

The non-projectedness of 𝔐_g has profound consequences for superstring
perturbation theory at genus g ≥ 5.
-/

/-- The naive approach to superstring amplitudes (FAILS for g ≥ 5).

    One might hope that the g-loop amplitude could be computed as:
      A_g = ∫_{M_g} dμ_B · ∫ dθ₁...dθ_{2g-2} · F(Ω, θ)

    where:
    - dμ_B is the Berezinian measure on the body M_g
    - θ_i are odd coordinates (gravitino zero modes)
    - F is the integrand from correlation functions

    This FAILS because:
    1. The split M_g × ℂ^{0|2g-2} structure doesn't exist globally
    2. The odd coordinates θ_i can't be chosen consistently
    3. For g ≥ 5, 𝔐_g has intrinsic supergeometric structure -/
structure NaiveAmplitudeApproach (g : ℕ) where
  /-- Would need a global splitting 𝔐_g ≅ Π(M_g, E) -/
  splittingNeeded : True
  /-- Fails for g ≥ 5 due to non-projectedness -/
  failsForHighGenus : g ≥ 5 → True

/-- The correct approach: intrinsic supermoduli integration.

    For g ≥ 5, the amplitude must be computed using:
    1. The Berezinian bundle Ber(𝔐_g) over the supermoduli space
    2. A global section (the integrand) coming from the worldsheet CFT
    3. Careful treatment of spurious singularities from picture changing

    The integral ∫_{𝔐_g} [dZ dΘ] · G(Z, Θ) is well-defined despite
    non-projectedness, because:
    - The Berezinian transforms correctly under coordinate changes
    - The integrand G comes from BRST-exact constructions
    - Spurious singularities cancel via vertical integration -/

/-- The picture-changing formalism for superstring amplitudes.

    **Historical development:**
    - Sen-Witten: Vertical integration prescription for handling spurious
      singularities in the PCO formalism (purely from the PCO perspective)
    - Wang-Yin (2022): Geometric connection to supermoduli, showing PCO
      configurations parameterize super charts on 𝔐_{g,n}

    **Key insight (Wang-Yin):**
    The picture-changing formalism should be understood geometrically:

    1. **Super charts**: Each choice of PCO locations {w_a} defines a local
       trivialization (super chart) of the supermoduli space 𝔐_{g,n}.
       The PCOs parameterize the odd directions in the chart.

    2. **Bosonic sections**: Within each chart, one can "integrate out" the
       odd directions, reducing to an integral over the bosonic moduli M_g.
       This gives a chain in M_g lifted from the super chart.

    3. **Gluing chains**: Different charts (different PCO configurations) give
       different bosonic chains. The full amplitude is obtained by:
       - Integrating over each chart's bosonic section
       - Interpolating between charts via the vertical integration prescription
       - The interpolation handles spurious singularities at chart boundaries

    4. **Integration cycle**: The result is a well-defined integration cycle
       on the supermoduli space, constructed by gluing chains lifted from
       bosonic charts and interpolating between overlapping chart domains.

    **Why this works despite non-projectedness:**
    - No global splitting needed; only local splittings (charts) are used
    - The interpolation (vertical integration) cancels spurious poles
    - BRST invariance ensures the result is chart-independent -/

/-- A super chart on the supermoduli space parameterized by PCO locations.

    Given PCO insertion points {w₁, ..., w_{2g-2}} on the worldsheet Σ,
    one obtains local coordinates on a neighborhood in 𝔐_{g,n}:
    - Even coordinates: moduli of the underlying curve and vertex positions
    - Odd coordinates: specified by the PCO locations

    Different choices of PCO locations give different (overlapping) charts.
    The transition functions between charts involve the PCO algebra. -/

  domain : Type*
  /-- Local trivialization (splitting) in this chart -/
  localSplitting : True

/-- The integration cycle on 𝔐_{g,n} via glued bosonic chains.

    **Construction (following Wang-Yin):**

    1. Cover 𝔐_{g,n} by super charts {U_α} parameterized by PCO configurations
    2. In each chart U_α, use the local splitting to define a bosonic section:
       σ_α : (U_α)_red → U_α setting odd coordinates to specific values
    3. The bosonic chain C_α = σ_α((U_α)_red) is a real (3g-3+n)-cycle
    4. On overlaps U_α ∩ U_β, the chains C_α and C_β differ by a boundary:
       C_α - C_β = ∂(interpolation)
    5. The vertical integration prescription provides the interpolation
    6. Glue to get a global integration cycle C = ∪_α C_α / (identifications)

    **Key property:** The integral ∫_C ω over this cycle is:
    - Independent of chart choices (BRST invariance)
    - Free of spurious singularities (cancellation in interpolation)
    - Equal to the supermoduli integral ∫_{𝔐_{g,n}} ω -/

/-- The vertical integration prescription (Sen-Witten).

    When PCO locations collide (w_a → w_b), spurious poles appear in the
    integrand. The vertical integration prescription handles this by:

    1. Deforming the integration contour in the space of PCO locations
    2. The deformation picks up residues that cancel the spurious poles
    3. The result is smooth in the limit w_a → w_b

    **Geometric interpretation (Wang-Yin):**
    In the supermoduli picture, vertical integration provides the interpolation
    between adjacent super charts. When transitioning from chart U_α (PCO
    configuration α) to U_β (configuration β), the vertical integration
    constructs the connecting chain between bosonic sections. -/
