# Moduli Spaces of Riemann Surfaces

This file provides the unified theory of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces,
bringing together three complementary perspectives:

1. **Analytic** (Teichmüller theory): See `Analytic/Moduli.lean`
   - Quasiconformal maps and Beltrami differentials
   - Teichmüller metric and Weil-Petersson geometry
   - Period map to Siegel upper half space

2. **Algebraic** (Stack theory): See `Algebraic/Moduli.lean`
   - Deligne-Mumford stacks
   - Coarse moduli space and compactification
   - Line bundles (Hodge, ψ-classes)

3. **Combinatorial** (Ribbon graphs): See `Combinatorial/Moduli.lean`
   - Penner's decorated Teichmüller space
   - Cell decomposition via fat graphs
   - Kontsevich intersection theory

## Mathematical Background

The moduli space M_g parametrizes isomorphism classes of compact Riemann surfaces
of genus g. Key facts:

### Dimension
- dim_ℂ M_g = 3g - 3 for g ≥ 2 (count: 3g-3 complex parameters)
- M_0 = point (ℂP¹ is unique)
- M_1 = ℂ (parametrized by j-invariant, or ℍ/SL₂(ℤ))

### Three Equivalent Constructions
1. **Analytic**: M_g = T_g / Mod_g (Teichmüller quotient)
2. **Algebraic**: M_g represents the moduli functor (as DM stack)
3. **Combinatorial**: M_g ≅ ∐_Γ (ℝ_{>0}^{E(Γ)} / Aut(Γ)) (cell decomposition)

### Key Structures
- Teichmüller space T_g: universal cover of M_g
- Mapping class group Mod_g: deck transformations
- Period map: T_g → H_g (Siegel upper half space)
- Deligne-Mumford compactification M̄_g: adds stable nodal curves

## The Moduli Functor and Stack

The moduli problem is properly formulated as a functor:
  M_g : (Schemes)^op → Sets
  S ↦ {families of genus g curves over S} / isomorphism

This functor is not representable by a scheme (due to automorphisms),
but is representable by a Deligne-Mumford stack.
-/

/-- A scheme (abstract definition for moduli theory).

    A scheme is a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to Spec(R)
    for commutative rings R. For our purposes, we need:
    - The notion of morphisms between schemes
    - Fiber products (for pullbacks of families)
    - The étale topology (for descent) -/

/-- A family of curves over a base scheme S.

    A family of genus g curves over S is a proper flat morphism π : C → S
    whose geometric fibers are connected smooth curves of genus g.

    This is the fundamental object that the moduli functor classifies. -/

/-- The moduli functor for genus g curves.

    M_g : (Schemes)^op → Groupoids
    S ↦ { families of genus g curves over S, with isomorphisms }

    This is a category-fibered-in-groupoids (CFG) over Schemes.
    The key property is that it satisfies descent for the étale topology,
    making it a stack. -/

    An algebraic stack is a category fibered in groupoids over Schemes that:
    1. Satisfies descent for the étale topology (is a stack)
    2. Has representable diagonal
    3. Admits a smooth surjective morphism from a scheme (smooth atlas) -/

/-- A Deligne-Mumford stack is an algebraic stack with étale atlas and finite automorphisms.

    DM stacks are the "mildest" kind of stack - they are locally quotients [X/G]
    for finite groups G. Key examples:

    When G is a finite group acting on a scheme X, the quotient stack [X/G]
    is a DM stack. Its points over a scheme S are pairs (P, φ) where
    P → S is a principal G-bundle and φ : P → X is G-equivariant. -/

    This is the "correct" moduli space that properly tracks automorphisms.
    - At a point [C] with automorphism group Aut(C), the stack remembers this group

## Deformation Theory

## Coarse Moduli Space

The coarse moduli space |M_g| is a quasi-projective variety that "approximates"
the stack. It exists and is unique, but loses automorphism information.

**Important distinction:**
- The **moduli stack** 𝓜_g is a Deligne-Mumford stack that properly tracks automorphisms
- The **coarse moduli space** M_g is an ordinary quasi-projective variety
- There is a canonical map 𝓜_g → M_g that is bijective on ℂ-points but forgets
  the stack structure (automorphism groups at each point)

For g ≥ 3, curves have no automorphisms generically, so M_g ≅ 𝓜_g away from
a locus of positive codimension. For g = 2, every curve has an involution (hyperelliptic),
and for g ≤ 1 there are continuous automorphism groups.
-/

/-- The coarse moduli space M_g as a quasi-projective variety.

    This is the actual geometric space whose ℂ-points parametrize isomorphism classes
    of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g. The coarse moduli space is:
    - A quasi-projective variety over ℂ (irreducible, smooth for g ≥ 2)
    - Analytically: the quotient T_g / Mod_g with its induced complex structure
    - Has dimension 3g - 3 for g ≥ 2 (a theorem, not a definition)

    **What we formalize:** The coarse space as a variety with:
    - Its ℂ-points (the underlying set)
    - Zariski tangent spaces at each point
    - The quasi-projective structure

    **What we don't capture:** The stack structure (automorphism groups).

## Contractibility of Teichmüller Space

Teichmüller space T_g is contractible for all g ≥ 0. This fundamental result
has several proofs:

1. **Earle-Eells (1969)**: T_g is homeomorphic to an open ball in ℝ^{6g-6}.
   The proof uses the Teichmüller metric and shows T_g is a cell.

2. **Bers embedding**: T_g embeds as a bounded domain in ℂ^{3g-3} via the
   Bers embedding. The image is a cell (bounded domain of holomorphy).

3. **Harmonic maps**: Eells-Sampson theory gives a retraction.

4. **Measured foliations (Thurston)**: T_g × MF_g is homeomorphic to the
   bundle of quadratic differentials, which is a vector bundle over T_g.
-/

/-- Contractibility data for Teichmüller space.

    A space is contractible if it is homotopy equivalent to a point.
    For T_g, we can exhibit an explicit contraction via the Teichmüller
    geodesic flow or the Bers embedding.

    **Key consequences:**
    - π_n(T_g) = 0 for all n ≥ 0
    - H_n(T_g) = 0 for n > 0, H_0(T_g) = ℤ
    - Any map S^n → T_g is null-homotopic -/

    **Proof sketch:**
    1. Fix a base point τ₀ ∈ T_g (e.g., the uniformized surface)
    2. For each τ ∈ T_g, there is a unique Teichmüller geodesic from τ₀ to τ
    3. Define h_t(τ) = point at distance (1-t)·d(τ₀,τ) along this geodesic
    4. h_0 = id, h_1 = const(τ₀), and h_t is continuous in both t and τ -/

    - Holomorphic functions give local coordinates

## The Bers Embedding

The Bers embedding realizes T_g as a bounded domain in the space of
quadratic differentials Q(Σ₀) ≅ ℂ^{3g-3}.

**Construction:**
1. Fix a base surface Σ₀ with marking
2. For τ ∈ T_g represented by (Σ, f), consider the quasi-Fuchsian
   group Γ_τ uniformizing Σ and its "conjugate" Σ̄
3. The Schwarzian derivative of the developing map gives a quadratic
   differential on Σ₀
4. This defines the Bers embedding β : T_g → Q(Σ₀)

**Properties:**
- Holomorphic embedding
- Image is a bounded domain (the Bers slice)
- Image is a domain of holomorphy
-/

/-- The Schwarzian derivative of a locally univalent function.

    For f : U → ℂ locally univalent (f' ≠ 0), the Schwarzian is:
      S(f) = (f''/f')' - (1/2)(f''/f')² = f'''/f' - (3/2)(f''/f')²

    This measures deviation from Möbius transformations (S(f) = 0 iff f is Möbius).
    The Schwarzian transforms as a quadratic differential under composition. -/
