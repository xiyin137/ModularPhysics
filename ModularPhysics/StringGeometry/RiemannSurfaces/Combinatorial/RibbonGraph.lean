# Ribbon Graphs (Fat Graphs)

This file develops the theory of ribbon graphs (also called fat graphs),
which are graphs with a cyclic ordering of half-edges at each vertex.

## Mathematical Background

A ribbon graph Γ determines a surface Σ(Γ) by "thickening" - replacing each
vertex with a disk and each edge with a strip, glued according to the
cyclic ordering. This is fundamental for:

1. **Penner's decorated Teichmüller space**: T̃_{g,n} decomposes into cells
   indexed by ribbon graphs, with coordinates given by edge lengths.

2. **Kontsevich's intersection theory**: Intersection numbers on M̄_{g,n}
   are computed as sums over ribbon graphs.

3. **Matrix models**: Feynman diagrams in matrix integrals are ribbon graphs.

## Main definitions

* `HalfEdge` - Half-edges with vertex attachment
* `RibbonGraph` - Graph with cyclic half-edge orderings
* `RibbonGraph.genus` - Genus of the thickened surface
* `RibbonGraph.eulerChar` - Euler characteristic V - E + F
* `MetricRibbonGraph` - Ribbon graph with edge lengths

## Key formulas

For a ribbon graph Γ with V vertices, E edges, F faces, and n boundary components:
- Euler characteristic: χ = V - E + F
- For closed surface: χ = 2 - 2g
- For surface with boundary: χ = 2 - 2g - n

## Half-Edges

Half-edges are the fundamental building blocks of ribbon graphs.
Each edge consists of two half-edges glued together.

## Ribbon Graphs

A ribbon graph consists of:
1. A finite set of vertices (identified by natural numbers)
2. A finite set of half-edges
3. An involution pairing half-edges into edges
4. A cyclic ordering of half-edges at each vertex
