# Quasiconformal Maps

This file defines quasiconformal maps, the fundamental tool in Teichmüller theory.

## Mathematical Background

A homeomorphism f : U → V between domains in ℂ is K-quasiconformal (K ≥ 1) if:
1. f is in the Sobolev space W^{1,2}_{loc}
2. The Beltrami coefficient μ_f = (∂f/∂z̄)/(∂f/∂z) satisfies |μ_f| ≤ k a.e.
   where k = (K-1)/(K+1) < 1

Equivalently, infinitesimal circles are mapped to infinitesimal ellipses
with eccentricity ratio at most K.

## Main Definitions

* `IsHomeomorphBetween` - Predicate for homeomorphisms between open sets
* `QuasiconformalMap` - K-quasiconformal map structure
* `BeltramiDifferential` - Infinitesimal deformations of complex structure
* `complexDilatation` - The Beltrami coefficient of a qc map
* `dilatationConstant` - The constant k = (K-1)/(K+1)

    **Key properties:**
    - K = 1 means conformal (holomorphic or antiholomorphic)
    - Composition: K(f ∘ g) ≤ K(f) · K(g)
    - Quasiconformal maps preserve measurability and null sets

/-- A Beltrami differential on a domain U ⊆ ℂ.

    A Beltrami differential μ is a measurable (-1,1)-form:
      μ = μ(z) dz̄/dz

    It represents an infinitesimal deformation of the complex structure.
    The deformed complex structure has local coordinate w where:
      dw̄/dw = μ dz̄/dz

    **Geometric interpretation:**
    - μ = 0 means the complex structure is unchanged
    - |μ| < 1 is required for the new structure to be well-defined
    - The new structure makes circles into ellipses with eccentricity (1+|μ|)/(1-|μ|)

    **Tangent space interpretation:**
    The space of Beltrami differentials (modulo trivial ones) is the tangent
    space to Teichmüller space at the given complex structure. -/

    If f is K₁-qc and g is K₂-qc, then g ∘ f is at most K₁K₂-quasiconformal.

/-- The Beltrami equation: ∂f/∂z̄ = μ · ∂f/∂z

    This is the fundamental PDE of quasiconformal mapping theory.
    For any measurable μ with ‖μ‖_∞ < 1, the equation has a unique
    normalized solution (fixing 0, 1, ∞).

    **Implementation note**: The `solves_beltrami` field should express that f
    satisfies the Beltrami equation ∂f/∂z̄ = μ · ∂f/∂z in the distributional sense.
    This requires Sobolev space infrastructure (W^{1,2}_{loc}) and weak derivatives.
    For now we use an existential statement that the appropriate weak derivative
    relationship holds. -/

    For any measurable Beltrami differential μ on ℂ with ‖μ‖_∞ < 1, there exists
    a unique quasiconformal homeomorphism f : ℂ → ℂ solving the Beltrami equation
    normalized by f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1. -/
