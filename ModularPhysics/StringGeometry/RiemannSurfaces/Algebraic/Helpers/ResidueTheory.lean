# Algebraic Residue Theory for Compact Algebraic Curves

This file develops the algebraic residue theory needed for the point exact sequence.

## Main Results

* `not_both_quotients_nontrivial` - L(D)/L(D-p) and L(K-D+p)/L(K-D) cannot both be nontrivial
* `not_both_quotients_trivial` - L(D)/L(D-p) and L(K-D+p)/L(K-D) cannot both be trivial

## Mathematical Background

The point exact sequence 0 → O(D-p) → O(D) → ℂ_p → 0 gives rise to a long exact sequence
in cohomology. The key constraint is that χ(D) - χ(D-p) = 1, which translates to:

  dim(L(D)/L(D-p)) + dim(L(K-D+p)/L(K-D)) = 1

Since both quotients have dimension at most 1, this means exactly one is nontrivial.

## Proof Strategy

**For (1,1) impossible:**
If both quotients are nontrivial, we can construct f ∈ L(D)\L(D-p) and g ∈ L(K-D+p)\L(K-D).
The product fg ∈ L(K+point(p)) has valuation exactly -(K(p)+1) at p.
By the residue theorem for 1-forms, this leads to a contradiction.

**For (0,0) impossible:**
If both quotients are trivial, the connecting homomorphism δ: ℂ → H¹(D-p) would be injective
(since a = 0 means eval = 0, so ker(δ) = im(eval) = 0). But then dim(im δ) = 1, which
by exactness equals b = 0, contradiction.

We implement these arguments using the algebraic structure of CompactAlgebraicCurve.

## The Key Non-existence Result for (1,1) Case

We show that both quotients cannot be simultaneously nontrivial.
The proof uses the argument principle and properties of the canonical divisor.
-/

/-- **Key lemma**: If both quotients L(D)/L(D-p) and L(K-D+p)/L(K-D) are nontrivial,
    we get a function h = fg in L(K+point(p)) with specific valuation constraints
    that lead to a contradiction via the argument principle.

    Mathematical argument:
    - h = fg has v_p(h) = -(K(p)+1) and v_q(h) ≥ -K(q) for q ≠ p
    - By argument principle: Σ v_q(h) = 0
    - This gives: v_p(h) + Σ_{q≠p} v_q(h) = 0
    - So: -(K(p)+1) + Σ_{q≠p} v_q(h) = 0
    - Therefore: Σ_{q≠p} v_q(h) = K(p)+1

    The constraint h ∈ L(K+point(p)) with exact valuation at p forces:
    h has a pole of order K(p)+1 at p, balanced by zeros/poles elsewhere.

    The residue theorem for 1-forms (equivalently, the constraint from the
    canonical divisor structure) prevents this configuration.

    **Current approach**: We show this implies a specific divisor structure
    that contradicts the leading coefficient uniqueness or other DVR properties. -/

  obtain ⟨g, hg⟩ := hg_exists

  obtain ⟨hg_ne, hg_in, hvg⟩ := hg

  -- h = fg has the required properties
  let h := f * g
  have hh_ne : h ≠ 0 := mul_ne_zero hf_ne hg_ne
  have hvh_p := product_valuation_at_p C ⟨hf_ne, hf_in, hvf⟩ ⟨hg_ne, hg_in, hvg⟩

  -- By the argument principle: Σ v_q(h) = 0
  have harg := C.argumentPrinciple h hh_ne

  -- h has valuation -(K(p)+1) at p
  -- For the argument principle to hold, the sum of valuations at other points
  -- must be K(p)+1

  -- The key insight: h ∈ L(K+point(p)) means (h) + K + point(p) ≥ 0
  -- Taking degrees: deg((h)) + deg(K) + 1 ≥ 0
  -- But deg((h)) = 0, so deg(K) + 1 ≥ 0

  -- This is consistent and doesn't give a direct contradiction.
  -- The actual contradiction comes from the residue theorem for 1-forms,
  -- which requires additional infrastructure.

  -- For now, we use the fact that having exact pole order -(K(p)+1) at p
  -- and being bounded below by -K(q) at all other points q
  -- leads to a specific divisor structure.

  -- The contradiction: if h has v_p(h) = -(K(p)+1) (a pole of exact order K(p)+1),
  -- and at all other points q, v_q(h) ≥ -K(q), then:
  -- Σ v_q(h) = v_p(h) + Σ_{q≠p} v_q(h) = -(K(p)+1) + Σ_{q≠p} v_q(h) = 0
  -- So Σ_{q≠p} v_q(h) = K(p)+1
  -- This means h has total "positive valuation" K(p)+1 away from p.

  -- For the 1-form hω₀ (where ω₀ has div(ω₀) = K):
  -- v_p(hω₀) = v_p(h) + K(p) = -(K(p)+1) + K(p) = -1 (simple pole)
  -- v_q(hω₀) = v_q(h) + K(q) ≥ -K(q) + K(q) = 0 (holomorphic)

  -- By the residue theorem: Σ res_q(hω₀) = 0
  -- Since hω₀ is holomorphic at q ≠ p, all residues are 0 except at p.
  -- So res_p(hω₀) = 0.
  -- But v_p(hω₀) = -1 (simple pole) means res_p(hω₀) ≠ 0. Contradiction!

  -- The residue theorem is equivalent to the statement:
  -- "There is no 1-form on a compact curve with exactly one simple pole."

  -- We encode this as a property of the canonical divisor.
  -- For a canonical divisor K, if h ∈ L(K+point(p)) has v_p(h) = -(K(p)+1),
  -- then the 1-form hω₀ has a unique simple pole, which is impossible.

  -- Implementation: We need to show this leads to a contradiction with
  -- the algebraic structure. The key is that the valuation constraints
  -- are incompatible with the argument principle when we consider 1-forms.

## The (0,0) Case: Both Quotients Cannot Be Trivial

If L(D) = L(D-p) and L(K-D+p) = L(K-D), we derive a contradiction.
-/

/-- If L(D) = L(D-p), there is no f with v_p(f) = -D(p) -/
def quotientTrivial (D : Core.Divisor C.toAlgebraicCurve) (p : C.Point) : Prop :=
  ∀ f, inRiemannRochSpace C f D → val C p f ≠ -D.coeff p ∨ f = 0

/-- The connecting homomorphism δ: ℂ → H¹(D-p) = L(K-D+p)*.

    For c ∈ ℂ, δ(c) is a linear functional on L(K-D+p).

    When quotientTrivial holds (a = 0), the evaluation map L(D) → ℂ is zero,
    so δ is injective by exactness (ker(δ) = im(eval) = 0).
    This means dim(im δ) = 1.

    By exactness at H¹(D-p): dim(im δ) = dim(ker(H¹(D-p) → H¹(D))).
    Using Serre duality: ker ≅ (L(K-D+p)/L(K-D))*, so dim = b.
    Therefore b = 1, contradicting b = 0. -/

  -- This means f ∈ L(D-p), so L(D) = L(D-p).

  -- The connecting homomorphism δ: ℂ → L(K-D+p)* is defined by:
  -- δ(c)(g) = c · res_p(t_p^{-D(p)} · g · ω₀)
  -- where t_p is the local parameter and ω₀ has div(ω₀) = K.

  -- When a = 0, the evaluation map eval: L(D) → ℂ is zero (since no f achieves v_p(f) = -D(p)).
  -- By exactness: ker(δ) = im(eval) = 0, so δ is injective.
  -- Therefore dim(im δ) = dim(ℂ) = 1.

  -- So ker has dimension dim(L(K-D+p)) - dim(L(K-D)) = b.
  -- Therefore b = dim(im δ) = 1.

/-- **Main theorem**: The quotient dimensions satisfy a + b = 1.

    For any divisor D and point p on a compact algebraic curve C with canonical divisor K:

    - b = dim(L(K-D+p)/L(K-D)) ∈ {0, 1}
    - a + b = 1 (exactly one quotient is nontrivial)
