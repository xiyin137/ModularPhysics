# Wick Rotation and the OS Bridge Theorems

This file develops the infrastructure for the Osterwalder-Schrader bridge theorems:
- **Theorem R→E** (`wightman_to_os`): Wightman functions → Schwinger functions (OS I, §5)
- **Theorem E'→R'** (`os_to_wightman`): Schwinger functions → Wightman functions (OS II, §IV-V)

## Theorem R→E (Wightman → OS)

Given Wightman functions W_n satisfying R0-R5, we construct Schwinger functions S_n
satisfying E0-E4. The construction (OS I, Section 5) proceeds as:

1. **Analytic continuation**: The spectrum condition (R3) implies W_n extends to a
   holomorphic function on the forward tube T_n.
2. **BHW extension**: The Bargmann-Hall-Wightman theorem extends W_n to the
   permuted extended tube T''_n, with complex Lorentz invariance and permutation symmetry.
3. **Define S_n**: Restrict the BHW extension to Euclidean points:
     S_n(τ₁, x⃗₁, ..., τₙ, x⃗ₙ) = W_analytic(iτ₁, x⃗₁, ..., iτₙ, x⃗ₙ)
4. **Verify E0-E4**:
   - E0 (temperedness): From R0 + geometric estimates (OS I, Prop 5.1)
   - E1 (Euclidean covariance): From complex Lorentz invariance (SO(d+1) ⊂ L₊(ℂ))
   - E2 (reflection positivity): From R2 (Wightman positivity)
   - E3 (permutation symmetry): From BHW permutation invariance
   - E4 (cluster): From R4

## Theorem E'→R' (OS → Wightman)

Given Schwinger functions S_n satisfying E0'-E4 (with E0' = linear growth condition),
we reconstruct Wightman functions satisfying R0'-R5. This follows OS II (1975).

The proof is inductive on the analytic continuation domain:

### Phase 1: Hilbert Space from Reflection Positivity (E2)
- Same GNS construction as Wightman reconstruction
- E2 gives positive semi-definite inner product on S₊ (positive-time test functions)
- Complete to Hilbert space H

### Phase 2: Semigroup from Euclidean Time Translation (E0' + E1)
- Translation in Euclidean time gives contraction semigroup e^{-tH} for t > 0
- E0' controls growth: the semigroup extends analytically
- H is a positive self-adjoint operator (the Hamiltonian)

### Phase 3: Analytic Continuation (OS II, Theorem 4.1-4.2, inductive)
- **Base case (A₀)**: Schwinger functions S_k(ξ) are analytic on ℝ₊^k, with estimates
- **Inductive step (Aᵣ)**: Extend to regions C_k^(r) in complexified time
- After d steps, reach the forward tube
- **Critical**: E0' is essential for temperedness estimates at each step

### Phase 4: Boundary Values → Wightman Distributions
- The analytic functions in the forward tube have distributional boundary values
- E0' ensures boundary values are tempered distributions
- Define W_n as these boundary values

### Phase 5: Verify Wightman Axioms
- R0 (temperedness): from E0' estimates
- R1 (Lorentz covariance): from E1 via BHW
- R2 (positivity): from E2
- R3 (spectrum condition): from the support of the analytic continuation
- R4 (cluster): from E4
- R5 (locality): from E3 + edge-of-the-wedge

/-- Define Schwinger functions from Wightman functions via Wick rotation.

    The construction uses the analytic continuation of W_n (from the spectrum condition)
    composed with the Wick rotation map (τ,x⃗) ↦ (iτ,x⃗):

      S_n(f) = ∫_x W_analytic_n(iτ₁, x⃗₁, ..., iτₙ, x⃗ₙ) f(x₁,...,xₙ) dx

    where W_analytic_n is the holomorphic extension of W_n to the forward tube
    (provided by the spectrum condition), and the integral is over Euclidean
    n-point configurations.

/-- The Schwinger functions constructed from Wightman functions satisfy temperedness (E0).

    This follows from the temperedness of Wightman functions (R0) and the
    geometric estimates in OS I, Proposition 5.1: the Wick-rotated kernel

/-- The Schwinger functions satisfy Euclidean covariance (E1).

    Proof: Complex Lorentz invariance of W_analytic on the permuted extended tube,
    together with the fact that SO(d+1) ⊂ L₊(ℂ) preserves Euclidean points.
    The translation invariance follows from changing variables in the integral
    and using translation invariance of W_analytic on the forward tube. -/

    Specifically, if F is supported in {τ > 0}, then the Borchers involution
    θF* composed with Wick rotation gives the conjugated-reversed sequence,
    and Σ W_{n+m}(θf*_n ⊗ f_m) ≥ 0 follows from R2 (Wightman positivity). -/

/-- Phase 2: The Euclidean time translation semigroup.

    For t > 0, define the operator T(t) on the Hilbert space by:
      T(t) [f](τ₁,...,τₙ) = [f(τ₁ + t,..., τₙ + t)]

    This gives a contraction semigroup with:
    - T(s)T(t) = T(s+t)
    - ‖T(t)‖ ≤ 1 (contraction, from E2)
    - T(t) → I as t → 0⁺ (strong continuity, from E0)

    By the Hille-Yosida theorem, T(t) = e^{-tH} where H ≥ 0 is self-adjoint.
    This H is the Hamiltonian of the reconstructed QFT. -/

/- Phase 3: Analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski.

    The analytic continuation proceeds inductively. Starting from Schwinger functions
    S_n defined on Euclidean configurations, we extend to complex times.

    **Inductive structure** (OS II, Theorem 4.1):
    - A₀: S_k(ξ) is analytic on {ξ ∈ ℝ^k : ξⱼ > 0 for all j}
    - Aᵣ: S_k has analytic continuation to the region C_k^(r) ⊂ ℂ^k
      where r of the ξ-variables are complexified
    - After n = d + 1 steps, reach the full forward tube

    **Key estimate** (OS II, Theorem 4.2): At each step, the linear growth
    condition E0' provides the bounds needed for the continuation. -/

/-- The inductive analytic continuation theorem (OS II, Theorem 4.1).

    Under E0' (linear growth condition), the Schwinger functions extend analytically
    from C_k^(r) to C_k^(r+1) at each step.

    The proof at each step uses:
    1. Laplace transform representation of S_k on C_k^(r)
    2. E0' bounds to control the growth of the Laplace transform
    3. Analytic continuation in one more variable -/

/-- The OS pre-Hilbert space constructed from the Wightman functions obtained
    via analytic continuation of Schwinger functions.

    In the OS reconstruction (OS II, 1975), the Wightman functions are obtained
    from the Schwinger functions by analytic continuation, using the linear growth
    condition E0' to control the distribution order growth.

    The pre-Hilbert space uses the Wightman inner product:
      ⟨F, G⟩ = Σ_{n,m} W_{n+m}(f̄_n ⊗ g_m)
    where W_n are the boundary values of the analytic continuation of S_n.

    **Requires the linear growth condition E0'**: Without it, the analytic
    continuation may fail to produce tempered boundary values (OS I, Lemma 8.8 gap).

    1. Has distributional boundary values equal to the Wightman functions W_n
    2. When restricted to Euclidean points (via Wick rotation) and paired with
       test functions, reproduces the Schwinger functions S_n
