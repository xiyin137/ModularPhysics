# GNS Construction for the Wightman Reconstruction Theorem

This file implements the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction that builds
a Hilbert space and field operators from Wightman functions, completing the
Wightman reconstruction theorem.

## Construction Overview

Starting from Wightman functions W = {W_n : S(ℝ^{n(d+1)}) → ℂ} satisfying
the required axioms, the reconstruction proceeds as follows:

### Step 1: Borchers Algebra (already in Reconstruction.lean)
- Elements are "Borchers sequences" F = (f_0, f_1, f_2, ...) where f_n ∈ S(ℝ^{n(d+1)})
  and only finitely many f_n are nonzero
- This forms a *-algebra under:
  - Addition: (F + G)_n = f_n + g_n
  - Scalar multiplication: (cF)_n = c · f_n
  - *-operation (Borchers involution): (F*)_n(x₁,...,xₙ) = conj(f_n(xₙ,...,x₁))

### Step 2: Inner Product (already in Reconstruction.lean)
- ⟨F, G⟩ = Σ_{n,m} W_{n+m}(f*_n ⊗ g_m)
- Positive-definiteness from the Wightman positivity axiom
- Hermiticity from W_n(f̃) = conj(W_n(f)) and the Borchers involution
- Sesquilinearity from linearity of W_n

### Step 3: Null Space and Pre-Hilbert Space (already in Reconstruction.lean)
- N = {F : ⟨F,F⟩ = 0} is a left ideal (from Cauchy-Schwarz)
- PreHilbertSpace = BorchersSequence / N
- The inner product descends to the quotient (proven: well-definiteness)

### Step 4: Completion to Hilbert Space
- Complete the pre-Hilbert space using Mathlib's uniform completion
- The inner product extends by continuity

### Step 5: Field Operators
- For f ∈ S(ℝ^{d+1}), define φ(f) on Borchers sequences by:
    (φ(f)F)_n = δ_{n≥1} · f ⊗ f_{n-1}  (prepend f to the sequence)
- This preserves N, so descends to the pre-Hilbert space
- Extends to an unbounded operator on the Hilbert space (on a dense domain)

### Step 6: Vacuum
- Ω = equivalence class of (1, 0, 0, ...) (the sequence with f_0 = 1, rest zero)
- ⟨Ω, φ(f₁)···φ(fₙ)Ω⟩ = W_n(f₁ ⊗ ··· ⊗ fₙ) by construction

### Step 7: Verify Wightman Axioms
- Poincaré covariance: from translation invariance and Lorentz covariance of W_n
- Spectrum condition: from the spectral condition on W_n
- Locality: from local commutativity of W_n
- Cyclicity: from the density of Borchers sequences

/-! ### Step 7: Poincaré Covariance -/

/- The Poincaré group acts on Borchers sequences via the pull-back:
    (g · F)_n = F_n ∘ g⁻¹

    For the translation subgroup: (T_a · F)_n(x₁,...,xₙ) = F_n(x₁-a,...,xₙ-a)
    For the Lorentz subgroup: (Λ · F)_n(x₁,...,xₙ) = F_n(Λ⁻¹x₁,...,Λ⁻¹xₙ)

    This action preserves the inner product by translation/Lorentz invariance of W_n,
    and hence descends to a unitary representation on the Hilbert space. -/

/-- The translation action on Borchers sequences preserves the inner product.

    If F' and G' are the translations of F and G by a ∈ ℝ^{d+1}, meaning
    F'_n(x₁,...,xₙ) = F_n(x₁-a,...,xₙ-a), then ⟨F', G'⟩ = ⟨F, G⟩.

    Proof: Each summand W_{n+m}((f')*_n ⊗ g'_m) = W_{n+m}(f*_n ⊗ g_m) by
    the translation invariance of the Wightman functions. -/

/- Summary of what the Wightman reconstruction theorem proves:

    Given: WightmanFunctions d (satisfying temperedness, Poincaré covariance,
    spectrum condition, locality, positive-definiteness, hermiticity, normalization)

    Construct:
    1. Hilbert space H = completion of BorchersSequence / {null vectors}
    2. Vacuum Ω = [vacuumSequence] ∈ H, with ‖Ω‖ = 1
    3. Field operators φ(f) : H → H (unbounded, on dense domain)
    4. Unitary representation U of Poincaré group on H

    Properties:
    - ⟨Ω, φ(f₁)···φ(fₙ)Ω⟩ = W_n(f₁ ⊗ ··· ⊗ fₙ)
    - U(g)Ω = Ω (vacuum is Poincaré-invariant)
    - U(g)φ(f)U(g)⁻¹ = φ(g·f) (covariance)
    - [φ(f), φ(g)] = 0 when supports of f, g are spacelike separated (locality)
    - Energy spectrum in forward cone (from spectrum condition)
    - span{φ(f₁)···φ(fₙ)Ω} is dense in H (cyclicity, from construction) -/
