# Wightman Reconstruction Theorem

This file provides the framework for the Wightman reconstruction theorem, which
establishes that a collection of Wightman functions satisfying appropriate properties
uniquely determines a Wightman QFT (up to unitary equivalence).

## Main Definitions

* `WightmanFunctions` - A collection of n-point functions satisfying Wightman properties
* `WightmanReconstruction` - The reconstruction of a Wightman QFT from functions
* `ReconstructionTheorem` - The main theorem statement

## Mathematical Background

The Wightman reconstruction theorem [Wightman, 1956; Streater-Wightman, 1964] states:

Given a collection of distributions W_n : 𝒮(ℝ^{n(d+1)}) → ℂ satisfying:
1. **Temperedness**: Each W_n is a tempered distribution
2. **Covariance**: W_n transforms appropriately under Poincaré transformations
3. **Spectrum condition**: Reflected in the support of the Fourier transform
4. **Locality**: Symmetry under exchange of spacelike-separated arguments
5. **Positive definiteness**: A sesquilinear form condition

Then there exists a unique (up to unitary equivalence) Wightman QFT with these
functions as its n-point functions.

/-! #### Actions on test functions

The Poincaré group acts on test functions by (g · f)(x) = f(g⁻¹ · x).
For the Schwartz space, we need to verify that these actions preserve the Schwartz class.
This is true but requires substantial analysis infrastructure. We define the actions
on plain functions and note where Schwartz preservation would be needed. -/

/-- Translation invariance: W_n(x₁+a, ..., xₙ+a) = W_n(x₁, ..., xₙ) for all translations a.

    At the distribution level: W_n(τ_{-a} f) = W_n(f) where (τ_a f)(x) = f(x - a).

    For distributions, this means ∂W_n/∂x_i^μ + ∂W_n/∂x_j^μ = 0 for all i,j,μ,
    i.e., W_n depends only on coordinate differences ξ_i = x_{i+1} - x_i.

    Concretely: W_n can be written as a distribution in n-1 difference variables. -/

/-- Lorentz covariance: W_n(Λx₁, ..., Λxₙ) = W_n(x₁, ..., xₙ) for all Λ ∈ O(1,d).

    For scalar fields, the Wightman functions are Lorentz invariant.
    For fields with spin s, there would be a transformation matrix D^{(s)}(Λ).

    At the distribution level: W_n(Λ⁻¹ · f) = W_n(f) where (Λ · f)(x) = f(Λ⁻¹x).

    We express this as invariance under the action of the Lorentz group on n-point
    configurations. -/

    (∀ x : NPointDomain d n, g.toFun x = f.toFun (fun i => Matrix.mulVec Λ⁻¹.val (x i))) →
    W n f = W n g

/-- Local commutativity condition for Wightman functions.

    For a collection of n-point functions W_n, local commutativity means:
    When points x_i and x_j are spacelike separated, swapping them in W_n
    doesn't change the value (for bosonic fields; fermionic fields get a sign).

    The precise condition is:
    W_n(..., x_i, ..., x_j, ...) = W_n(..., x_j, ..., x_i, ...)
    when (x_i - x_j)² > 0 (spacelike separation in mostly positive signature).

    At the distribution level, this is expressed via test functions with
    spacelike-separated supports: if supp(f) and supp(g) are spacelike separated,
    then W₂(f ⊗ g) = W₂(g ⊗ f). -/

      This is equivalent to the energy-momentum spectrum lying in the forward cone.

      The condition is expressed via analytic continuation: W_n extends to a
      holomorphic function on the forward tube T_n. By the Bargmann-Hall-Wightman
      theorem, this is equivalent to the spectral support condition.

      We require:

/-! ### The Reconstruction Theorem -/

/-- The Wightman reconstruction theorem (statement).

    Given a collection of Wightman functions W_n satisfying the required properties
    (temperedness, Poincaré covariance, spectral condition, locality, positivity),
    there exists a unique (up to unitary equivalence) Wightman QFT whose n-point
    functions match W_n on product test functions.

    The relationship between the QFT's smeared n-point function and W_n is:
      ⟨Ω, φ(f₁)···φ(fₙ)Ω⟩ = W_n(f₁ ⊗ ··· ⊗ fₙ)

    where f₁ ⊗ ··· ⊗ fₙ denotes the tensor product of test functions.

    **Note**: The full proof requires:
    1. GNS construction from the positive definite form on Borchers sequences
    2. Verification that the constructed operators satisfy the Wightman axioms
    3. Nuclear theorem to extend from product to general test functions

    This is a foundational theorem of axiomatic QFT established by Wightman (1956)
    and elaborated in Streater-Wightman (1964). -/

/-! ### Connection to Euclidean Field Theory

The Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) axioms provide an alternative formulation of QFT
in Euclidean signature. The relationship between Wightman and OS axioms is:

**Wightman → OS (Direct, Theorem R→E)**:
Given a Wightman QFT satisfying R0-R5, one obtains Schwinger functions by
Wick rotation (analytic continuation t → -iτ). The Wightman axioms directly
imply the OS axioms E0-E4 for the resulting Euclidean theory.

**OS → Wightman (The OS Gap)**:
The converse is more subtle. In their first paper (OS I, 1973), Osterwalder and
Schrader claimed that axioms E0-E4 were sufficient. However, **Lemma 8.8 of OS I
was found to be incorrect** (first questioned by Simon). In their second paper
(OS II, 1975), they state:

  "At present it is an open question whether the conditions (E0-E4) as introduced
   in OS I are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a Wightman theory."

**The Linear Growth Condition (E0')**:
To fix the reconstruction, OS II introduces the **linear growth condition**:

  (E0') S₀ = 1, Sₙ ∈ S'₀(ℝ^{4n}) and there exist s ∈ ℤ₊ and a sequence {σₙ}
        of factorial growth (σₙ ≤ αβⁿ(n!)^γ for constants α, β, γ), such that
        |Sₙ(f)| ≤ σₙ ‖f‖_{s,n}

The issue is that analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowski involves
infinitely many Schwinger functions Sₖ. Without control over the growth of the
order of Sₖ as k → ∞, one cannot prove that the boundary values are tempered
distributions (the Wightman temperedness axiom R0).

**Theorem E'→R' (OS II)**: Schwinger functions satisfying E0' and E1-E4 define
a unique Wightman QFT satisfying R0-R5, with the Wightman distributions also
satisfying a linear growth condition R0'.

/-- The linear growth condition E0' from OS II (1975).

    This replaces the simple temperedness E0 with a stronger condition:
    There exist s ∈ ℤ₊ and constants α, β, γ such that for σₙ ≤ αβⁿ(n!)^γ,
      |Sₙ(f)| ≤ σₙ ‖f‖_{s,n}

    This condition controls the growth of the distribution order as n → ∞,
    which is essential for proving temperedness of the reconstructed
    Wightman distributions. -/

/-- Theorem R→E (Wightman → OS): A Wightman QFT directly yields Schwinger
    functions satisfying OS axioms E0-E4 via Wick rotation t → -iτ.
    This direction is straightforward (no gap). -/
theorem wightman_to_os (qft : WightmanQFT d) :

  -- Wick rotation t → -iτ applied to Wightman functions gives Schwinger functions
  -- satisfying OS axioms E0-E4. This is Theorem R→E of OS I.
  sorry

/-- Theorem E'→R' (OS II): Schwinger functions satisfying the linear growth
    condition E0' together with E1-E4 can be analytically continued to
    Wightman distributions satisfying R0-R5.

    **Critical**: Without the linear growth condition, this theorem may be FALSE.
    The issue is that analytic continuation involves infinitely many Sₖ, and
    without growth control, the boundary values may fail to be tempered.

    The reconstructed Wightman distributions also satisfy a linear growth
    condition R0'. -/
