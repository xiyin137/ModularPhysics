# Nuclear Spaces

This file defines nuclear spaces using Grothendieck/Pietsch characterization.

## Main Definitions

* `NuclearSpace` - A locally convex space E is nuclear if for every continuous seminorm p,
  there exists a continuous seminorm q ≥ p such that p is "nuclearly dominated" by q.
* `NuclearFrechet` - A nuclear Fréchet space presented via seminorms with nuclear steps.

## Mathematical Background

A locally convex topological vector space E is **nuclear** (Grothendieck) if its topology
is defined by a family of seminorms {p_α} such that for every p_α, there exists p_β ≥ p_α
with the canonical map from the completion of E/ker(p_β) to E/ker(p_α) being a nuclear
operator.

Equivalent characterizations:
1. (Grothendieck) Via nuclear maps between seminorm completions
2. (Pietsch) For every continuous seminorm p, there exist fₙ ∈ E* and cₙ ≥ 0 with
   Σ cₙ < ∞ such that p(x) ≤ Σ |fₙ(x)| · cₙ and each fₙ continuous
3. (Schwartz) Projective limit of Hilbert spaces with Hilbert-Schmidt connecting maps

Key examples: S(ℝⁿ), C^∞(M), distributions, finite-dimensional spaces.
Non-examples: infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.

/-! ### Nuclear Space Definition (Pietsch characterization) -/

/-- A locally convex topological vector space over ℝ is **nuclear** if for every continuous
    seminorm p, there exist continuous linear functionals (fₙ : E →L[ℝ] ℝ) and non-negative
    reals (cₙ) with Σ cₙ < ∞, and a continuous seminorm q ≥ p, such that:
    (1) p(x) ≤ Σₙ |fₙ(x)| · cₙ for all x
    (2) |fₙ(x)| ≤ q(x) for all x, n

    This is Pietsch's characterization, equivalent to Grothendieck's definition that
    the canonical map E_q → E_p between seminorm completions is nuclear.

    We follow the `LocallyConvexSpace` pattern in Mathlib for the type class binders. -/

/-- Finite-dimensional spaces are nuclear.

    The proof uses a basis b₁,...,bₙ with coordinate functionals φᵢ. Given any
    continuous seminorm p, we construct q = p + Σᵢ |φᵢ| as the dominating seminorm,
    and use φᵢ, cᵢ = p(bᵢ) for the nuclear decomposition. The triangle inequality
    p(x) = p(Σ φᵢ(x)·bᵢ) ≤ Σ |φᵢ(x)|·p(bᵢ) provides the nuclear bound. -/

/-! ### Helper: Linear Functional Continuity from Seminorm Bound -/

/-- A linear functional bounded by a continuous seminorm is continuous
    in a topological additive group.

    This is a standard result in functional analysis: if |φ(x)| ≤ p(x) where
    p is a continuous seminorm, then φ is continuous because for any ε > 0,
    the preimage φ⁻¹((-ε, ε)) contains the open ball {x | p(x) < ε} which
    is a neighborhood of 0. Continuity at 0 gives continuity everywhere
    by translation invariance (TopologicalAddGroup). -/

/-! ### Nuclear Fréchet Space Presentation -/

/-- A nuclear Fréchet space presented as a sequence of seminorms with nuclear steps.
    This is the most practical formulation for QFT applications.

    The space E comes equipped with a countable family of seminorms (pₙ)
    that define its topology, and for each n the "identity" from (E, pₙ₊₁)
    to (E, pₙ) admits a nuclear factorization: there exist linear functionals φₖ
    bounded by pₙ₊₁ and summable coefficients cₖ with pₙ(x) ≤ Σₖ |φₖ(x)| · cₖ.

    For Schwartz space, the pₙ are the Schwartz seminorms involving
    polynomial weights and derivatives.

    The `instIsTopologicalAddGroup` field ensures the topology is compatible
    with the additive group structure, which is needed for continuous linear
    functionals to be well-behaved (e.g., continuity at 0 ⟹ continuity). -/

/-! ### Connection to NuclearSpace class -/

/-- A nuclear Fréchet presentation gives rise to a NuclearSpace instance.

    The key step is that any continuous seminorm p on E is bounded by some
    C * pₙ (by the generating property of the defining seminorms), and then
    the nuclear_step condition for pₙ provides the nuclear decomposition.
    We absorb the constant C into the coefficients and scale pₙ₊₁ to serve
    as the dominating seminorm q. -/
