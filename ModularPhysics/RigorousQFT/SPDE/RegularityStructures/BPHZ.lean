# BPHZ Renormalization for Regularity Structures

This file formalizes the BPHZ (Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann) renormalization
procedure for regularity structures (Hairer 2014, Section 8).

## Main Definitions

* `RenormalizationGroupRS` - The renormalization group acting on models
* `BPHZCharacter` - The BPHZ character computing renormalization constants
* `RenormalizedModel` - The renormalized model Π^{ren}

## Mathematical Background

The BPHZ procedure in regularity structures works as follows:

1. **Identify divergent trees**: Trees τ with |τ| < 0 have divergent expectations
2. **Renormalization group**: G acts on models by Π_x^g τ = Π_x (g · τ)
3. **BPHZ formula**: The renormalization element g ∈ G is computed recursively
   by subtracting divergences from each tree

The key insight (connecting to classical QFT renormalization) is that:
- Trees correspond to Feynman diagrams
- Negative homogeneity corresponds to UV divergence
- The recursive BPHZ formula is the same as in perturbative QFT

Unlike the BHZ (Bruned-Hairer-Zambotti) approach using Hopf algebras, we use
the direct recursive formula from Hairer 2014.

/-! ## The Renormalization Group

The structure group G acts on models. Renormalization is achieved by
choosing the right element g ∈ G such that Π^g has finite limits.

    Elements M ∈ G are linear maps M : T → T such that:
    - M preserves homogeneity sectors: M(T_α) ⊆ ⊕_{β ≤ α} T_β
    - M acts triangularly: (M τ)_α = τ_α + lower order terms

  Π^g_x τ = Π_x (g · τ)

This changes the model while preserving its analytical structure.

naive model Π_x τ has divergent expectations that must be subtracted.

/-! ## The BPHZ Character

The BPHZ character computes the renormalization constants recursively.
For each tree τ with |τ| < 0, we compute the counterterm:

  g_τ = -E[Π^{ren}_x τ] + (lower order corrections)

This is the direct approach from Hairer 2014, without Hopf algebras.

    is computed recursively:

    - g(Ξ) = 0 (noise is already normalized)
    - g(X^k) = 0 (polynomials need no renormalization)

/-! ## The Renormalized Model

The BPHZ renormalization produces a model Π^{ren} that:
1. Agrees with Π on subcritical trees (|τ| ≥ 0)
2. Has finite limits on critical trees (|τ| < 0)
3. Is universal: independent of the mollification

This is Theorem 8.3 from Hairer 2014.

    Key properties:
    - Π^{ren}_x τ = Π_x τ for subcritical τ

    - Π^{ren} has a finite limit as ε → 0 -/

/-! ## Explicit BPHZ Formula

The BPHZ character is computed recursively. For a tree τ with |τ| < 0:

  g(τ) = -E[Π_0(τ - Σ_{σ ⊂ τ, |σ| < 0} g(σ) · τ/σ)]

where the sum is over divergent subtrees σ of τ, and τ/σ denotes the
contraction of σ in τ.

For the 3D Φ⁴ model, the trees requiring renormalization are:
- I(Ξ)² with |τ| = -1

Each gives a divergent counterterm (mass renormalization).

corresponding to the (∇h)² nonlinearity. The renormalization
gives a single divergent constant (energy counterterm).
