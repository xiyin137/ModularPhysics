# Jensen's Functional Equation implies Linearity

This file proves that a continuous function D : ℝ → ℝ satisfying Jensen's functional equation
D(s + t) + D(s - t) = 2 * D(s) with D(0) = 0 must be linear: D(t) = t * D(1).

This is a key step in the spectral theorem via RMK approach, needed to prove
that the "odd part" of the quadratic form Q(w + tv) is linear in t.

## Main results

- `jensen_implies_linear_on_rat`: D(q) = q * D(1) for all rationals q
- `jensen_implies_linear`: D(t) = t * D(1) for all reals t (if D is continuous)
