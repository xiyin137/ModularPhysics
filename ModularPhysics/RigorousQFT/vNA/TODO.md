# vNA Module TODO

## Overview

This module develops von Neumann algebra foundations for rigorous QFT, including:
- Unbounded self-adjoint operators
- Spectral theory via Riesz-Markov-Kakutani (RMK)
- Stone's theorem for one-parameter unitary groups
- Modular theory (Tomita-Takesaki)

## Current Status

### Spectral Theory via RMK (Primary Approach)

The RMK-based approach constructs spectral measures using the Riesz representation theorem,
avoiding the circular dependencies of the traditional CFC approach.

| File | Status | Sorrys |
|------|--------|--------|
| `Spectral/SpectralFunctionalViaRMK.lean` | Complete | 0 |
| `Spectral/SpectralMeasurePolarizedViaRMK.lean` | Complete | 0 |
| `Spectral/SpectralTheoremViaRMK.lean` | Complete | 0 |
| `Spectral/SpectralViaCayleyRMK.lean` | **Complete** | 0 |

### Completed Sorrys in SpectralViaCayleyRMK.lean

All three sorrys have been resolved:

1. ✅ **`hU_P_eq_P`**: Proved `U ∘L P({1}) = P({1})` using dominated convergence
   - Used decomposition: id = Re + i·Im on Circle
   - Proved Re·g_n → χ_{1} and Im·g_n → 0 pointwise
   - Applied `spectralFunctionalAux_tendsto_of_pointwise_general` for weak convergence

2. ✅ **`hP_eigenvector`**: Proved `U (P y) = P y`
   - Followed directly from `unitary_comp_spectralProjection_singleton_one`

3. ✅ **`spectralMeasureFromRMK_univ`**: Proved `P(ℝ) = 1`
   - Showed `μ_{x,y}({1}) = 0` using `P({1}) = 0` and sesquilinear form
   - Used measure additivity: `μ(univ) = μ({z ≠ 1}) + μ({1})`
   - Concluded `μ(cayleyToCircle '' univ) = ⟨x, y⟩`

### Legacy Approach (Lower Priority)

The original approach uses CFC directly but has many sorrys due to circularity issues.

| File | Status | Sorrys |

| `Unbounded/Spectral.lean` | Needs Migration | 11 |
| `Unbounded/StoneTheorem.lean` | Needs Migration | 9 |
| `Spectral/FunctionalCalculusFromCFC.lean` | Superseded | 27 |
| `Spectral/FunctionalCalculusFromCFC/Basic.lean` | Superseded | 1 |

## Path to Stone's Theorem

Stone's theorem establishes a 1-1 correspondence:
- **Forward**: Self-adjoint operator T → one-parameter unitary group U(t) = exp(itT)
- **Inverse**: One-parameter unitary group U(t) → self-adjoint generator A

### Forward Direction (from RMK spectral theorem)

The spectral theorem via RMK is now complete:
```
spectral_theorem_via_RMK : ∀ T self-adjoint, ∃ P : PVM on ℝ
```

The one-parameter unitary group is then defined via spectral integration:
```lean
U(t) := ∫ exp(itλ) dP(λ)
```

**Key steps to prove:**
1. `U(t)` is well-defined (spectral integral of bounded function)
2. `U(t)` is unitary: `U(t)* = U(-t)` (since `exp(itλ)* = exp(-itλ)`)
3. Group property: `U(s+t) = U(s) U(t)` (by CFC multiplicativity)
4. Strong continuity: `U(t)x → x` as `t → 0` (dominated convergence)
5. Generator recovery: `dU(t)/dt|_{t=0} = iT` on dom(T)

### Inverse Direction

Given a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group U(t):

1. **Define the generator domain:**
   ```
   dom(A) = { x ∈ H : lim_{t→0} (U(t)x - x)/(it) exists }
   ```

2. **Show dom(A) is dense:**
   - For smooth φ with compact support, x_φ := ∫ φ(t) U(t)x dt ∈ dom(A)
   - Taking φ → δ gives density

3. **Show A is symmetric:**
   - ⟨Ax, y⟩ = lim_{t→0} ⟨(U(t)x - x)/(it), y⟩
   - Use U(t)* = U(-t) and inner product continuity

4. **Show A is self-adjoint (the hard part):**
   - Symmetry gives A ⊆ A*
   - Must show dom(A*) ⊆ dom(A)
   - Strategy: For y ∈ dom(A*), show ∫₀^t U(s)y ds ∈ dom(A)
     and differentiate to get y ∈ dom(A)

5. **Show U(t) = exp(itA):**
   - Define V(t) := exp(itA) from spectral theorem
   - Show V satisfies same ODE as U
   - Conclude V = U by uniqueness

### Implementation Strategy

After completing `SpectralViaCayleyRMK.lean`:

1. **New file: `StoneTheoremViaRMK.lean`**
   - Import `SpectralViaCayleyRMK.lean`
   - Define `exp_i_t_T : ℝ → (H →L[ℂ] H)` via spectral integral
   - Prove it forms a strongly continuous unitary group
   - Prove generator recovery theorem

2. **Migrate existing `StoneTheorem.lean`:**
   - Replace sorrys with proofs using RMK infrastructure
   - Key: use `spectralMeasureFromRMK` for the PVM
   - The generator domain computation uses spectral theory

## Technical Notes

### Why RMK?

The traditional approach to spectral theory uses:
1. CFC for bounded normal operators → spectral projections
2. Cayley transform to reduce unbounded to bounded
3. But CFC itself uses spectral theory, creating circularity

The RMK approach breaks this by:
1. Defining spectral functional Λ_z(f) = Re⟨z, cfc(f, U) z⟩
2. Using RMK to get a measure μ_z from Λ_z
3. Extending to polarized measure μ_{x,y} via polarization
4. Defining P(E) via sesquilinear form: ⟨x, P(E) y⟩ = μ_{x,y}(E)

### Key Lemmas Available

- `spectralFunctionalAux_tendsto_closed`: Dominated convergence for thickened indicators
- `spectralProjection_polarized_product_closed`: ⟨P x, P y⟩ = μ_{x,y}(F)
- `spectralProjection_idempotent_closed`: P(F)² = P(F) for closed F
- `spectralMeasurePolarized_univ`: μ_{x,y}(Circle) = ⟨x, y⟩
- `one_not_eigenvalue`: For Cayley transform U, U x = x ⟹ x = 0
