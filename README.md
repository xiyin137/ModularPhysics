# ModularPhysics

This repository previously contained a monorepo for rigorous formalization of mathematical physics in Lean 4 with Mathlib. It has been split into separate repositories:

## Repositories

- [StochasticPDE](https://github.com/xiyin137/StochasticPDE) — Stochastic PDE methods for constructive QFT, including Itô calculus, regularity structures, and nonstandard analysis.
- [StringGeometry](https://github.com/xiyin137/StringGeometry) — Riemann surfaces, supermanifolds, super Riemann surfaces, and topology infrastructure.
- [StringAlgebra](https://github.com/xiyin137/StringAlgebra) — L-infinity algebras, multiple zeta values, and vertex operator algebras.
- [OSreconstruction](https://github.com/xiyin137/OSreconstruction) — Wightman axioms, Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction, and von Neumann algebra infrastructure.
- [PhysicsLogic](https://github.com/xiyin137/PhysicsLogic) — Logical architecture of theoretical physics. For parsing physics papers, not rigorous formalization.
